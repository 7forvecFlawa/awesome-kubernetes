## Performance Testing

## Kubernetes conformance testing tools
- Mastercard, for example, checks every deployment with Kubernetes conformance testing tools such as sonobuoy and kubench.
- [sonobuoy](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy) is a diagnostic tool that makes it easier to understand the state of a Kubernetes cluster by running a set of plugins (including Kubernetes conformance tests) in an accessible and non-destructive manner. It is a customizable, extendable, and cluster-agnostic way to generate clear, informative reports about your cluster.
- [kubench](https://github.com/vincentserpoul/kubench) Benchmark different containerized applications within a kubernetes cluster.
