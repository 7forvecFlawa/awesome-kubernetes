## Release Testing
- [launchdarkly.com: Release Testing Explained ðŸŒŸ](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/get-a-detailed-explanation-of-release-testing-several/) Release testing refers to coding practices and test strategies that give teams confidence that a software release candidate is ready for users. Release testing aims to find and eliminate errors and bugs from a software release so that it can be released to users. Letâ€™s dive in and explore several methods used to perform release testing.

## Tools
* [collabnix.com: The Ultimate Docker Tutorial for Automation Testing](https://collabnix.com/the-ultimate-docker-tutorial-for-automation-testing/)
    * [TestProject](https://testproject.io/) Free Test Automation for All.
* [Allure Report ðŸŒŸ](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2)
    * [Allure Jenkins Plugin ðŸŒŸ](https://plugins.jenkins.io/allure-jenkins-plugin/) This plugin allows to automatically generate [Allure Report](http://allure.qatools.ru/) and attach it to build during Jenkins job run.
* [venturebeat.com: Reflect brings automated no-code web testing to the cloud](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/22/reflect-brings-automated-no-code-web-testing-to-the-cloud/)
* [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) Static analysis at ludicrous speed. Find bugs and enforce code standards
    * [meetup.com: A single open-source security scanner for most languages on Jenkins](https://www.meetup.com/es/Jenkins-online-meetup/events/276135789/) As software security is becoming an increasingly bigger organization risk, static and dynamic analysis are becoming indispensable. However most popular open-source static analysis scanners cover only a handful of languages, or offer limited security rules. In this talk, weâ€™ll present Semgrep, an open-source static analysis tool that support 12+ languages, and simplifies writing custom rules for organization-specific code patterns. In addition, weâ€™ll show how to integrate Semgrep into a Jenkins Pipeline for scanning every commit or PR.
* [testcontainers ðŸŒŸ](https://github.com/testcontainers) Testcontainers is a Java library that supports JUnit tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container.
    * [thenewstack.io: Testcontainers Integration Library Gets Commercial Backing with AtomicJar](https://thenewstack.io/testcontainers-integration-library-gets-commercial-backing-with-atomicjar/)
* [Metabob](https://www.metabob.com/) Metabob is an AI Static Analysis Tool that enables developers to quickly identify the causes behind errors and performance sinks. An AI-assisted tool to visualize and debug Python code.
## Performance Testing
- [devops.com: Best Practices for Application Performance Testing](https://devops.com/best-practices-for-application-performance-testing/)

## Kubernetes conformance testing tools
- Mastercard, for example, checks every deployment with Kubernetes conformance testing tools such as sonobuoy and kubench.
- [sonobuoy](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy) is a diagnostic tool that makes it easier to understand the state of a Kubernetes cluster by running a set of plugins (including Kubernetes conformance tests) in an accessible and non-destructive manner. It is a customizable, extendable, and cluster-agnostic way to generate clear, informative reports about your cluster.
- [kubench](https://github.com/vincentserpoul/kubench) Benchmark different containerized applications within a kubernetes cluster.
