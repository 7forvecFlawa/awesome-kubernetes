    * [meetup.com: A single open-source security scanner for most languages on Jenkins](https://www.meetup.com/es/Jenkins-online-meetup/events/276135789/) As software security is becoming an increasingly bigger organization risk, static and dynamic analysis are becoming indispensable. However most popular open-source static analysis scanners cover only a handful of languages, or offer limited security rules. In this talk, weâ€™ll present Semgrep, an open-source static analysis tool that support 12+ languages, and simplifies writing custom rules for organization-specific code patterns. In addition, weâ€™ll show how to integrate Semgrep into a Jenkins Pipeline for scanning every commit or PR.

## Performance Testing
- [devops.com: Best Practices for Application Performance Testing](https://devops.com/best-practices-for-application-performance-testing/)

## Kubernetes conformance testing tools
- Mastercard, for example, checks every deployment with Kubernetes conformance testing tools such as sonobuoy and kubench.
- [sonobuoy](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy) is a diagnostic tool that makes it easier to understand the state of a Kubernetes cluster by running a set of plugins (including Kubernetes conformance tests) in an accessible and non-destructive manner. It is a customizable, extendable, and cluster-agnostic way to generate clear, informative reports about your cluster.
- [kubench](https://github.com/vincentserpoul/kubench) Benchmark different containerized applications within a kubernetes cluster.
