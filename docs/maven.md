* [Dzone.com: Maven Dependency Management Without Going Full Maven](https://dzone.com/articles/maven-dependency-management-without-going-full-mav) If you like using Maven to manage your projects, check out the MyEclipse IDE with its dependencies only mode, allowing you to take advantage of just this feature

```
mvn dependency:analyze  (shows you the usage of listed and unlisted dependencies)
mvn dependency:resolve  (give me a list of everything I have declared, a nice way to avoid reading the POM file)
mvn dependency:tree     (how you got something on your classpath)
```

## Maven and Docker

## IDEs
* [Dzone: Maven, Eclipse, and Java 9](https://dzone.com/articles/maven-eclipse-and-java-9) Eclipse users who use Maven are used to the M2E plugin issue of having your JRE reset on you. But there's an additional gotcha between Java 8 and Java 9.
