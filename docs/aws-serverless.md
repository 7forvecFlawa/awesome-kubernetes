The answer might surprise you.
    - There are use cases for both, but the consensus for production development lives with a hybrid approach: performing a base set of actions synchronously, like validations and id creation **and kicking off the rest of the processing asynchronously**. You’d then [use a WebSocket](https://betterprogramming.pub/introduction-to-aws-websockets-8b336a92c379) to inform the user when the workflow is complete.
