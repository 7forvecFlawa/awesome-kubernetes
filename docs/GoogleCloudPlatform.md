- [cloud.google.com: 5 cheat sheets to help you get started on your Google Cloud journey ðŸŒŸ](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/5-google-cloud-product-cheat-sheets-2021) Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words, and thatâ€™s where these cheat sheets come in handy. Cloud Developer Advocate Priyanka Vergadia has built a number of guides that help developers visually navigate critical decisions, whether itâ€™s determining the best way to move to the cloud, or deciding on the best storage options. Below are five of her top cheat sheets in one handy location.

## Managing Cluster Level Configuration
- [Config Sync Overview](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/add-on/config-sync/overview) One of the most challenging day two concerns for Kubernetes users is managing cluster level configuration, think namespaces, CRDs, and RBAC rules, across multiple clusters. For GKE customers Config Sync is a game changer.

## Serverless
