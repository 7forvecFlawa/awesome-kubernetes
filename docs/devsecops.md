## Kubernetes Config Security Threats
- [cncf.io: Identifying Kubernetes Config Security Threats: Pods Running as Root](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/06/16/identifying-kubernetes-config-security-threats-pods-running-as-root/)
- [mirantis.com: Introduction to Istio Ingress: The easy way to manage incoming Kubernetes app traffic](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/introduction-to-istio-ingress-the-easy-way-to-manage-incoming-kubernetes-app-traffic/) Leaving your cluster exposed can be risky. That's why you need Istio Ingress, which only exposes the part that handles incoming traffic & allows routing rules based on routes, headers, IP addresses and more.
