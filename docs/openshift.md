    * [Install RedHat OKD 3.10 on your development box:](https://github.com/gshipley/installcentos) This repository is a set of scripts that will allow you easily install the latest version (3.10) of OKD in a single node fashion. What that means is that all of the services required for OKD to function (master, node, etcd, etc.) will all be installed on a single host. The script supports a custom hostname which you can provide using the interactive mode.]
    * A few other options to use OKD locally include [oc cluster up](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md) and [minishift](https://www.okd.io/minishift/). These may be a better fit for your use case if you only need a quick throwaway environment.
