## Introduction
* [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) A tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally inside a Linux VM. It's aimed on users who want to just test it out or use it for development. It cannot spin up a production cluster, it's a one node machine with no high availability.

* [**kind**](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) Kubernetes IN Docker - local clusters for testing Kubernetes
    * [kubernetes-development-environment-in-a-box](https://github.com/ManagedKube/kubernetes-development-environment-in-a-box) This project is geared toward running multiple isolated KinD cluster on a single instance. This project produces an AMI image that can run an instance that has Docker and multiple isolated Kubernetes clusters running in it using KinD. The main use case is to setup one node that can run multiple fully isolated Kubernetes cluster on it for development purposes.

## Telepresence local development for k8s and openshift microservices
* [telepresence.io ðŸŒŸ](https://www.telepresence.io) Fast, local development for kubernetes and openshift microservices.
* [telepresence.io: Debug a Kubernetes service locally ðŸŒŸ](https://www.telepresence.io/tutorials/kubernetes) Imagine you have a service running in a cluster, and someone reports a bug. You want to run the service locally but how? Enter Telepresence

* [telepresence.io: Intercept a service in your own environment ðŸŒŸ](https://www.telepresence.io/docs/latest/howtos/intercepts/) Today, I needed to intercept traffic sent to the application running on Kubernetes and forward it to the local dev instance.
