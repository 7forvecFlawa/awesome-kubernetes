## Introduction
- [thenewstack.io: Chaos Engineering Is Not Just for Ops](https://thenewstack.io/chaos-engineering-is-not-just-for-ops/)
- [==dzone: How to Pinpoint and Fix Distributed Problems Across Microservices==](https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-pinpoint-and-fix-distributed-problems-acros) While logical separation of APIs fosters parallel development of independent functions, complexity and interdependency becomes harder to manage.
