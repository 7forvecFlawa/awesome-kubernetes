* [kcp: a prototype of a Kubernetes API server that is not a Kubernetes cluster - a place to create, update, and maintain Kube-like APIs with controllers above or without clusters](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp) Kubernetes is mainly known as a container orchestration platform today, but we believe it can be even more. With the power of CustomResourceDefinitions, Kubernetes provides a flexible platform for declarative APIs of all types, and the reconciliation pattern common to Kubernetes controllers is a powerful tool in building robust, expressive systems. At the same time, a diverse and creative community of tools and services has sprung up around Kubernetes APIs. Imagine a declarative Kubernetes-style API for anything, supported by an ecosystem of Kubernetes-aware tooling, separate from Kubernetes-the-container-orchestrator. That's kcp.
