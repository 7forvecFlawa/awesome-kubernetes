- [kubernetes.io: Introducing kustomize; Template-free Configuration Customization for Kubernetes ðŸŒŸ](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/05/29/introducing-kustomize-template-free-configuration-customization-for-kubernetes/) If you run a Kubernetes environment, chances are youâ€™ve customized a Kubernetes configuration â€” you've copied some API object YAML files and edited them to suit your needs. But there are drawbacks to this approach â€” it can be hard to go back to the source material and incorporate any improvements that were made to it. Today Google is announcing kustomize, a command-line tool contributed as a subproject of SIG-CLI. The tool provides a new, purely declarative approach to configuration customization that adheres to and leverages the familiar and carefully designed Kubernetes API.
