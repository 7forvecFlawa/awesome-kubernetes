## Introduction
- [wikipedia.org: .NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET) .NET (previously named .NET Core) is a free and open-source, managed computer software framework for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. It is a cross-platform successor to .NET Framework. The project is primarily developed by Microsoft employees by way of the .NET Foundation, and released under the MIT License.

## Polly .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library 
- [App-vNext/Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) Polly is a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library that allows developers to express policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback in a fluent and thread-safe manner.
