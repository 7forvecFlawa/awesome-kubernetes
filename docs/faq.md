### Migration Styles. Lift and Shift Cloud Migration Strategy
- [From monolith to containers: How Verizon containerized legacy applications on OpenShift ðŸŒŸ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6i0LK4vHsU):
    - Lift and shift is a cloud migration strategy that refers to removing workloads and tasks from one storage location and placing them in another, usually cloud-based, location.
    - Moving applications to the cloud can be challenging if you are unprepared. In fact, many businesses experience some level of migration failure because of poor planning.
    - The lift and shift migration style is one of the approaches that can help you transition to the cloud without the need to redesign applications or disrupt workflow operations.
    - It all starts with containerizing the applications using platforms like Docker and then moving entirely to a microservices architecture.
