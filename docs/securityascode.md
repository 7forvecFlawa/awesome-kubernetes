- [k8s-security-policies](https://github.com/raspbernetes/k8s-security-policies) This repository provides a security policies library that is used for securing Kubernetes clusters configurations. The security policies are created based on CIS Kubernetes benchmark and rules defined in Kubesec.io. The policies are written in Rego, a high-level declarative language, its purpose-built for expressing policies over complex hierarchical data structures. For detailed information on Rego see the Policy Language documentation.

- [yor.io](https://yor.io/) Automated IaC tag and trace. Yor is an open-source tool that automatically tags infrastructure as code (IaC) templates with attribution and ownership details, unique IDs that get carried across to cloud resources, and any other need-to-know information. Run Yor as a pre-commit hook or in your CI/CD pipeline for code to cloud traceability and auditability.

- [aws.amazon.com: Policy-based countermeasures for Kubernetes â€“ Part 1](https://aws.amazon.com/es/blogs/containers/policy-based-countermeasures-for-kubernetes-part-1/) Choosing the right policy-as-code solution for your Kubernetes cluster:
    - OPA
    - Gatekeeper
    - Kyverno
    - k-rail
    - MagTape

## Kyverno
- [Kyverno ðŸŒŸ](https://kyverno.io/) Kubernetes Native Policy Management. Open Policy Agent? Thatâ€™s old school. Securely manage workloads on your kubernetesio clusters with this handy new tool, Kyverno.Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. With Kyverno, policies are managed as Kubernetes resources and no new language is required to write policies. This allows using familiar tools such as kubectl, git, and kustomize to manage policies. Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources. The Kyverno CLI can be used to test policies and validate resources as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
