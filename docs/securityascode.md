- [k8s-security-policies](https://github.com/raspbernetes/k8s-security-policies) This repository provides a security policies library that is used for securing Kubernetes clusters configurations. The security policies are created based on CIS Kubernetes benchmark and rules defined in Kubesec.io. The policies are written in Rego, a high-level declarative language, its purpose-built for expressing policies over complex hierarchical data structures. For detailed information on Rego see the Policy Language documentation.
