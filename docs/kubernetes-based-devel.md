## Non-production Kubernetes Local Installers. Kubernetes distributions for local environments. Desktop K8s
* [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) A tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally inside a Linux VM. It's aimed on users who want to just test it out or use it for development. It cannot spin up a production cluster, it's a one node machine with no high availability.

    * [nfrankel.medium.com: Goodbye minikube](https://nfrankel.medium.com/goodbye-minikube-340070edc5af) I‚Äôve been using minikube as my local cluster since I started to learn Kubernetes. But I‚Äôve decided to let it go in favor of kind. Here‚Äôs the story.
* [**kind**](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) Kubernetes IN Docker - local clusters for testing Kubernetes. Kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container ‚Äúnodes‚Äù. kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.
    * [kubernetes-development-environment-in-a-box](https://github.com/ManagedKube/kubernetes-development-environment-in-a-box) This project is geared toward running multiple isolated KinD cluster on a single instance. This project produces an AMI image that can run an instance that has Docker and multiple isolated Kubernetes clusters running in it using KinD. The main use case is to setup one node that can run multiple fully isolated Kubernetes cluster on it for development purposes.

- [==kubevious== üåüüåü](https://github.com/kubevious/kubevious) Kubevious is a read-only dashboard and config validator. Kubevious gives deep insights on app config and structure.
- [==tilt.dev==](https://tilt.dev) You can use Tilt to easily build and run your application on Kubernetes. In comparison with similar tools, it provides [UI for managing the process and cloud platform](https://cloud.tilt.dev) to share data with your team.
    - [medium: Happy trip to Kubernetes in our company](https://medium.com/condorlabs-engineering/happy-trip-to-kubernetes-in-our-company-85ecfde573fd) Kubernetes Local Development Made Easy! Not Minikube, neither Skaffold, but Tilt to the rescue. 
        - Minikube: Initially, they found Minikube as the first solution to manipulate K8s and test everything in our local environment. To manually deploy a service in Minikube they had to build the image in docker every time they made a change. If you are only managing one service this would be easy to handle, but if we work with many services in a repository that needs to be running to work as expected, we should have a way to run those builds automatically and restart the pods to take the new image.
        - Skaffold: They researched how to automatize this and found Skaffold, a tool to create a complete dev environment fully integrated with Kubernetes and Minikube. Skaffold takes over to build all the images that you need, restart the pods and listen for more changes. With this, you can achieve a hot-building feature sending everything to minikube, the devs won‚Äôt have to take care of this task. It was a win for them to find this tool.
        - Challenge: Something that caused friction for the developers was the way they had to run all the code locally. They had to make changes using docker-compose and then, test using Skaffold. This may generate little delays in the development workflow.
        - Tilt to the rescue: Finally, they found Tilt - An open-source tool that is focused on generating a comfortable and customizable rebuild for Docker and Kubernetes. Tilt makes really easy to manage development in a local environment of many services that need to communicate among them. Also, it‚Äôs focused on the Developer Experience. Once they implemented Tilt, they were able to use their services in the dev phase by running: tilt up. With a well-written configuration and settings, you can get reloads in a few milliseconds using the sync feature. Also, it has easy integration with Helm which is the most used package manager for K8s.

While Skaffold has limited ability to define Kubernetes applications and build and deploy them in CI/CD pipelines, it‚Äôs core functionality is creating a development environment for Kubernetes. In this blog post, I‚Äôll discuss the alternative tools of doing just that ‚Äì spinning up a development environment on Kubernetes. So let‚Äôs go into an in-depth comparison of Skaffold, Tilt, and Garden. **I will not be covering Microsoft Draft, as the Github repository appears to be archived and has had no new versions in 2020.**

While kubectl is the de-facto standard interface to interact with Kubernetes' API, a graphical user interface can provide a better experience for newcomers and advanced users alike. This talk will look at the current landscape of Open Source Kubernetes web and desktop UIs, including Kubernetes Dashboard, Lens, Octant, Kubernetes Web View, and Headlamp. Particularly, how different dashboards are built, for what purpose they can be used, and how they compare in terms of functionality, so attendees can get the most out of the vast landscape of Kubernetes UIs.
