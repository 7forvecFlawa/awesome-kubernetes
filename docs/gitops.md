### Jenkins
- There are many tools in the market that have been technically built for GitOps, like [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux), and [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/). All these tools have in-built proficiency to implement GitOps process for you. But we are going to use our old beloved Jenkins.

Learn how a productivity framework can help your DevOps initiative succeed.
- [Kubestack üåü](https://www.kubestack.com/): [Doc:](https://www.kubestack.com/framework/documentation) Kubestack is an open-source GitOps framework for infrastructure automation built on Terraform and Kustomize. It‚Äôs designed for teams that want to automate Kubernetes based infrastructure and not reinvent automation. Think of it this way, Kubestack is to Terraform and infrastructure automation, what Spring Boot is to Java and cloud native applications. The framework supports all three major cloud providers and has been used as the foundation for a number of real world customer projects as part of my colleagues‚Äô and my consulting work. It is fully documented, has a step-by-step tutorial to help users get started and even includes a local [GitOps development lab](https://www.kubestack.com/framework/documentation/tutorial-build-local-lab). So you can test-drive Kubestack and learn more about GitOps for infrastructure automation in the comfort of your own localhost.
