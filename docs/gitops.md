## GitOps Working Group
- [GitOps Working Group üåü](https://github.com/gitops-working-group/gitops-working-group)
- The Five GitOps Principles (as defined by the GitOps Working Group) to the lifecycle of an infrastructure resource, like a virtual machine or load balancer:
	- Declarative Configuration (define the resource as code)
	- Version controlled (use source control to manage the resource definition)
	- Automated delivery (provision and manage the resource from the definition using automation)
	- Software Agents (implement automated configuration management for the resource)
	- Closed loop (build the delivery pipeline for integration testing for resource changes)

It‚Äôs designed for teams that want to automate Kubernetes based infrastructure and not reinvent automation. Think of it this way, Kubestack is to Terraform and infrastructure automation, what Spring Boot is to Java and cloud native applications. The framework supports all three major cloud providers and has been used as the foundation for a number of real world customer projects as part of my colleagues‚Äô and my consulting work. It is fully documented, has a step-by-step tutorial to help users get started and even includes a local [GitOps development lab](https://www.kubestack.com/framework/documentation/tutorial-build-local-lab). So you can test-drive Kubestack and learn more about GitOps for infrastructure automation in the comfort of your own localhost.
