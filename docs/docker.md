- [brianchristner.io: How to use Docker Security Scan Locally](https://brianchristner.io/how-to-use-docker-scan/) Docker included a new command called `docker scan` that scans local images against the Snyk security engine, providing you with security visibility into your local Dockerfiles and images.

## How To Build a Smaller Docker Image
* [developers.redhat.com: Keep it small: a closer look at Docker image sizing](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/03/09/more-about-docker-images-size/)
* [medium: How to build a smaller Docker image](https://medium.com/@gdiener/how-to-build-a-smaller-docker-image-76779e18d48a) When you‚Äôre building a Docker image it‚Äôs important to keep the size under control. Having small images means ensuring faster deployment and transfers.
* [itsopensource.com: How to Reduce Node Docker Image Size by 10X](https://itsopensource.com/how-to-reduce-node-docker-image-size-by-ten-times/)
* [blog.bitsrc.io: Best Practices for Writing a Dockerfile](https://blog.bitsrc.io/best-practices-for-writing-a-dockerfile-68893706c3) Optimize your Docker Image by following these best practices from day one.
* [sequoia.makes.software: Reducing Docker Image Size (Particularly for Kubernetes Environments) üåü](https://sequoia.makes.software/reducing-docker-image-size-particularly-for-kubernetes-environments/)
* [itnext.io: Building Docker Images The Proper Way üåü](https://itnext.io/building-docker-images-the-proper-way-3c9807524582) Let‚Äôs optimize Docker builds to create much smaller and more secure Docker images in a fraction of the usual build time‚Ä¶

## Reducing Build Time
* [nrmitchi.com: One Simple Trick for Building Images Faster üåü](https://www.nrmitchi.com/2020/10/one-simple-trick-for-building-images-faster/?utm_sq=gkugwn5n5s)
    * ``BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1 build-arg`` is a neat flag that you could add to your docker build to reduce the build time upto 89%
* [pythonspeed.com: Docker BuildKit: faster builds, new features, and now it‚Äôs stable](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-buildkit/) Building Docker images can be slow, and Docker‚Äôs build system is also missing some critical security features, in particular the ability to use build secrets without leaking them. So over the past few years the Docker developers have been working on a new backend for building images, BuildKit.

## Modify containers without rebuilding

## Docker Tools

- [docker-ecs-plugin: Docker Releases Plugin for Simplified Deployments into AWS ECS and Fargate](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/07/docker-ecs-plugin/)
- [dive üåü](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) A tool for exploring a docker image, layer contents, and discovering ways to shrink the size of your Docker/OCI image. Use the dive tool to analyze a Docker image of your application. What did I learn? While Jib creates 3 layers for Spring Boot app (dependencies, resources and classes), Paketo Buildpacks places resources and classes in the same layer.

## Cloud Native Buildpacks
- [buildpacks.io: Cloud Native Buildpacks üåü](https://buildpacks.io/) transform your application source code into images that can run on any cloud.
- [altoros.com: Streamlining the Creation of Docker Images with Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://www.altoros.com/blog/streamlining-the-creation-of-docker-images-with-cloud-native-buildpacks/) The new Cloud Native Buildpacks framework changes the obnoxious development chore of Dockerfile writing into a simple, automated operations pipeline. When deploying apps to Kubernetes or other container-as-a-service platforms, the proliferation of nonstandard, unauditable containers built manually via Dockerfiles is a real problem. A few products have emerged to solve this problem, among them Cloud Native Buildpacks (–°NB). In this blog post, we explore the capabilities of these buildpacks and explain how to use them in build pipelines to deliver standardized, auditable images as artifacts suitable for deployment.
