    * When people focusing more on the security of containers, distroless based images are frequently used to reduce the attack surface. In these images, the package manager, the non-dependent modules or libraries, even the shells are stripped off, only the app and its required dependencies are kept. For the statically linked executable, produced by golang for example, we can even use ‚Äúscratch‚Äù as the base.
    * The potential exploit of vulnerability is therefore greatly reduced. But, on the other hand, it is difficult to troubleshoot the application if even the shell is not available, leaving only the logs from the app.
    * In this paper, we will explore different options to facilitate debugging by bringing back the shell.

In this article, you‚Äôll learn a few possible reasons a node might enter the **NotReady** state and how you can debug it.

This issue can be frustrating if you are unfamiliar with it, so in this guide, you will walk the reader through how to troubleshoot this issue, what some common causes are, and where to start if they encounter this problem.
* [==opensource.googleblog.com: Introducing Ephemeral Containers==](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/01/Introducing%20Ephemeral%20Containers.html) **Ephemeral containers are a new type of container that are part of the Kubernetes core API. An Ephemeral Container may be added to an existing Pod for administrative actions like debugging, it runs until it exits, and it won't be restarted. An ephemeral container runs within the Pod's existing resource allocation and shares common container namespaces.**
