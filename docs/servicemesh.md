```
[Installed @Linkerd in staging yesterday using Helm and Terraform](https://twitter.com/DanielJamesPost). It was incredibly easy to setup and immediately helped me diagnose tricky latency issues between services. I have no idea why I didnâ€™t do this sooner. Canâ€™t wait to get this into production.

### xDS protocol (Envoy's Discovery Service Protocol)
- [xDS REST and gRPC protocol](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-docs/xds_protocol)
- "The [gRPC project](https://grpc.io/faq/) is adding support for the **xDS protocol**, think Envoy Proxy as a library, which will provide a subset of functionality without an external proxy. ðŸ¤¯ The best part, xDS based control planes such as Istio, Traffic Director, and Consul Connect should just work."

## Kourier
- [Kourier: A lightweight Knative Serving ingress](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/30/kourier-a-lightweight-knative-serving-ingress/)
- https://github.com/knative/net-kourier : Kourier is an Ingress for Knative Serving. Kourier is a lightweight alternative for the Istio ingress as its deployment consists only of an Envoy proxy and a control plane for it.
