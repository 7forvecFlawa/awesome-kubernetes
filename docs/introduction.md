## From SysAdmin to Architect
- [redhat.com: 5 strategies to shift your career from sysadmin to architect](https://www.redhat.com/architect/from-sysadmin-to-architect) Many engineers make the shift from hands-on-keyboard system administration to building architectures as an architect. Here are five ways they make the shift.

## Raft Consensus Algorithm
- [The Raft Consensus Algorithm üåü](https://raft.github.io/) [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd) is a ‚Äúdistributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system‚Äù. It uses the Raft consensus algorithm which was designed to be easy to understand, to scale, and to operate. The protocol and the etcd implementation were very quickly adopted by large distributed systems like Kubernetes, large distributed databases or messaging frameworks, where consensus and strong consistency is a must.

## Monolith to Microservices Using the Strangler Pattern
- [dzone: Monolith to Microservices Using the Strangler Pattern üåü](https://dzone.com/articles/monolith-to-microservices-using-the-strangler-patt) The Strangler Pattern is a popular design pattern to incrementally transform your monolithic application into microservices by replacing a particular functionality with a new service. Once the new functionality is ready, the old component is strangled, the new service is put into use, and the old component is decommissioned altogether.
