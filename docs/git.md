## Design By Contract
[Wikipedia: Design by contract (DbC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract), also known as contract programming, programming by contract and design-by-contract programming, is an approach for designing software. 

It prescribes that software designers should define formal, precise and verifiable interface specifications for software components, which extend the ordinary definition of abstract data types with preconditions, postconditions and invariants. These specifications are referred to as "contracts", in accordance with a conceptual metaphor with the conditions and obligations of business contracts.

### Feature Branch Development (aka GitFlow)
* [nvie.com: Feature Branches. A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

#### Git Flow 
* One of the main concepts of **GitFlow** is **feature branches**. The idea is that each feature should be developed in its own branch. When the feature is done, it gets merged into develop branch. 
* [atlassian.com: Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
* [gitkraken.com: GitFlow](https://support.gitkraken.com/git-workflows-and-extensions/git-flow/) is a list of rules to keep a repoâ€™s history organized, and is used to make the release process, bug fixes, and feature creation easier.
