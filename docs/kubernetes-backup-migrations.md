## Introduction
* [kube-backup: Kubernetes resource state sync to git](https://github.com/pieterlange/kube-backup)  
* [Stash](https://github.com/stashed/stash) If you are running production workloads in Kubernetes, you might want to take backup of your disks, databases etc. Stash is a cloud native data backup and recovery solution for Kubernetes workloads

* [k8s-snapshots: Automatic Volume Snapshots on Kubernetes](https://github.com/miracle2k/k8s-snapshots) is an operator that creates and expires snapshots according to annotations to your PersistentVolume or PersistentVolumeClaim resources.
* [infracloud.io: Protecting Kubernetes applications data using Kanister](https://www.infracloud.io/blogs/protecting-kubernetes-applications-with-kanister)
    * [kanister.io ðŸŒŸ](https://kanister.io/) An extensible open-source framework for application-level data management on Kubernetes. KANISTER allows domain experts to capture application specific data management tasks in blueprints which can be easily shared and extended. The framework takes care of the tedious details around execution on Kubernetes and presents a homogeneous operational experience across applications at scale.
    * [blog.kasten.io: Move Fast and Test in Kubernetes without Breaking Things with kanister and CI/CD ðŸŒŸ](https://blog.kasten.io/move-fast-and-test-in-kubernetes-without-breaking-things)
        * When using data mobility to improve your CI/CD pipeline, itâ€™s important to consider the data at different layers in your application stack. In many instances, you must perform operations on multiple layers of your application at once, as well as interact with Kubernetes itself. Kasten by Veeam developed Kanister to address these data mobility challenges and enable organizations to test safely with real data.
        * Kanister, an open source project, provides a Kubernetes-native framework for application-level data management that supports complex data management workflows. Domain experts can capture application-specific data management tasks in blueprints, which can be easily shared and extended, eliminating many of the tedious details around execution on Kubernetes. 
        * Kanister is easy to integrate with your CI/CD pipeline, because it uses Kubernetes API extensions called custom resources. You can easily extend Kanister to work with custom applications as well as several common cloud native databases, simplifying and streamlining testing operations while reducing risk.
