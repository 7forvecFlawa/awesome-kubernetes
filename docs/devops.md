## Configuration Drift
- [Dzone: Configuration Drift üåü](https://dzone.com/articles/configuration-drift) Configuration Drift is the phenomenon where running servers in an infrastructure become more and more different as time goes on, due to manual ad-hoc changes and updates, and general entropy.
- [What is Configuration Drift?](https://www.continuitysoftware.com/blog/it-resilience/what-is-configuration-drift/) Configuration drift  is a data center environment term. At a high level, configuration drift happens when production or primary hardware and software infrastructure configurations ‚Äúdrift‚Äù or become different in some way from a recovery or secondary configuration or visa versa.  Production or primary and recovery or secondary configurations are designed to be identical in certain aspects is order for business resumption should there be a disaster or major failure in production.  When these infrastructure configurations drift from another, they leave a gap between them which commonly called a configuration gap.

### Data Driven DevOps Automation with Ketpn. Automating Service Level Indicators/Service Level Objectives based build validation with Keptn and Jenkins
- [Keptn](https://www.keptn.sh) provides **automated SLI/SLO-based quality gates** Introduction to Data Driven DevOps Automation. Keptn is a CNCF sandbox project and aims to automate delivery and operational processes using a data-driven approach. Keptn‚Äôs architecture solves a key problem with traditional automation tools where process and tool integrations are often hard coded or hard to maintain. Keptn uses an event-driven orchestrator with declarative process and tooling definitions that eliminate the need for any custom tool integration and make changing processes or tools a matter of changing a config file entry! At the core Keptn integrates with your observability platforms to automate SRE best practices such as SLO validation as part of your DevOps delivery and operations automation. Start automating your DevOps processes with Keptn to cover SLO-based Quality Gates, Performance & Chaos Test Automation, Event Driven Delivery as well as SRE-driven Auto-Remediation.

- [Keptn Jenkins Shared Library](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/keptn-jenkins-library) **integrates Jenkins and Keptn** with just a couple of function calls.
- [Jenkins Online Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup/events/270861119/) Andreas Grabner from Dynatrace will talk about **automating Service Level Indicators/Service Level Objectives based build validation with Keptn and Jenkins.** 
    - In many organizations up to 80% of pipeline execution time is spent in manual build validation steps. How can we reduce that? One option is applying Google's SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) practices by **automating SLI (Service Level Indicators) & SLO (Service Level Objectives) based build validation**. This method has proven to detect problematic issues in production and also allows us to automatically approve or reject builds being pushed through our pipelines.
    - In this session you learn the basics of picking good **SLIs & SLOs** and how to extract them from your monitoring tools. After this session you will be able to start implementing this integration yourself with Jenkins. To give you a jump start you will be introduced to the open source project [Keptn](https://www.keptn.sh) which provides **automated SLI/SLO-based quality gates**. Then we'll talk about [Keptn Jenkins Shared Library](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/keptn-jenkins-library) which **integrates Jenkins and Keptn** with just a couple of function calls.

### Puppet
- [puppet.com: Reporting üåü](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7.5/reporting_about.html) As more projects adopt the Kubernetes Resource Model for managing things beyond containers, we really need a reporting framework to help people understand configuration drift. 

### Relay
- [Relay](https://relay.sh/) Event-driven automation that connects the cloud providers, DevOps tools, and other APIs you already use.
- Automation tools can learn a lot from the CI/CD and Serverless ecosystems. Relay by **PuppetLabs** leverages **Tekton** and **Knative** in an attempt to do just that.
- [zdnet.com: Puppet introduces beta of cloud-native, event-driven DevOps program: Relay](https://www.zdnet.com/article/puppet-introduces-beta-of-cloud-native-event-driven-devops-program-relay/#ftag=RSSbaffb68) The open-source wants to expand DevOps to cover cloud and containers with its newest program.
