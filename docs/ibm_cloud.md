## IBM Cloud Paks and OpenShift
* [IBM Cloud Pak Playbook: cloudpak8s.io](https://cloudpak8s.io/) 
* **What are IBM Cloud Paks?** Beyond containers and Kubernetes, enterprises need to orchestrate their production topology, and to provide management, security and governance for their applications. They need to do this while improving efficiency and resiliency, reducing costs and maximizing ROI.
* IBM CloudÂ® Paks are enterprise-ready, containerized software solutions that give clients an open, faster and more secure way to move core business applications to any cloud. Each IBM Cloud PakÂ® includes containerized IBM middleware and common software services for development and management, on top of a common integration layer â€” designed to **reduce development time by up to 84 percent and operational expenses by up to 75 percent**. **IBM Cloud Paks run wherever Red HatÂ® OpenShiftÂ® runs** and are optimized for productivity and performance on [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift).

### CloudPaks For Applications (CP4A)
* [IBM Cloud Pak For Applications Overview](https://cloudpak8s.io/apps/cp4a_overview/) The **Cloud Pak for Applications** provides product offerings to support **modernizing existing applications and building new cloud native applications**. The applications run within a **Kubernetes cluster** provided with the **Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform**. The focus provided here is on running application workloads as containers. The Cloud Pak for Applications is a bundle of multiple offerings.  This diagram provides an overview of what offerings are included and what they would be used for:
